# AGENTS.md — DSH APP (dsh-app)

## 1. Visão geral do projeto

DSH APP is a **branded desktop client for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`)** — an Electron app
for Windows / macOS / Linux, aimed at public release. MIT.

The essential design idea is **"self-contained, no fork"**:

- The app **ships and installs its own versioned dsh kernel runtime** under
  `<userData>/kernel/`. It never depends on (or detects) a system-installed
  `dsh` CLI.
- All brand functionality is delivered as a **dsh plugin suite layered on the
  upstream kernel** (`plugins/`). Upstream `dsh` is never forked or patched,
  so every upstream release is just an ordinary kernel update.
- There are **two independent update channels**: the Electron shell
  (Windows: custom latest.yml detection + mirror download + visible NSIS
  wizard; macOS/Linux: `electron-updater` → GitHub Releases) and the dsh
  kernel (`KernelManager` → npm registry + `runtime-<version>` GitHub
  Release artifacts). They are decoupled: an upstream dsh release never
  requires a new shell build.
- Kernel updates are **atomic and reversible**: activation is a single atomic
  rewrite of `current.json`, keeping the previous version for rollback.

Full architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (authoritative). User-facing
README: `README.md`.

## 2. Pilha tecnológica

- **Electron 33** main process (shell), **TypeScript 5.7**, compiled to
  **CommonJS / ES2022** via `tsc` (`tsconfig.json`). `"main": "dist/main/index.js"`.
  Deps are minimal by design: `electron-updater`, `semver`, `tar`.
- **electron-builder 25** for packaging; **esbuild** for the plugin bundles.
- The **rendered UI is not this repo's code**: the shell spawns the dsh web
  server and loads its web UI in a sandboxed `BrowserWindow`. The harness
  lives in a sibling checkout (`../deepseek-harness`) and is built with
  **pnpm** (development only — production uses a bundled kernel runtime).
- Node.js 22+ required for development; `npm` for this repo, `pnpm` for the
  harness checkout.

### src/main (Electron shell)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | Boot, single-instance lock, lifecycle orchestration, crash/rollback/cancel logic, kernel + server wiring |
| `server.ts` | `DshServer`: spawn/health-check/restart/graceful-shutdown of the dsh child process; log redaction; settled-URL parsing |
| `window.ts` | `createMainWindow` (sandboxed, desktop chrome injection, title-bar overlay sync, export toast, in-window update status card) |
| `tray.ts` | System tray menu (open, check kernel/app update, restart server, quit) |
| `updater.ts` | Shell update channel: Windows custom latest.yml + mirror download + visible NSIS wizard (direct GUI spawn, pending-install record consumed on next boot); macOS/Linux via `electron-updater` |
| `update-card.ts` | Pure injected update-card script (message + progress bar) shared by kernel and shell update progress |
| `brand-suite.ts` | Suite seams: plugin symbolic links into `$DSH_HOME` + loader overlay copy |

### src/kernel (runtime manager)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `manager.ts` | `KernelManager`: init / check-update / download / extract / verify / activate / rollback / cleanup; `getServerSpec()` |
| `manifest.ts` | `current.json` read/write (atomic tmp+rename), `manifest.json` read helpers |
| `integrity.ts` | sha512 file hashing + comparison |
| `sources/registry.ts` | npm registry dist-tag resolution (`stable`/`beta`/`alpha`), registry fallback chain |
| `sources/artifact.ts` | GitHub Release artifact resolution + mirror fallback chain (sha512-pinned) |
| `sources/dev.ts` | Dev mode: build a manifest from the local checkout |

## 4. Estrutura do runtime do kernel e fluxo de atualização

```
<userData>/kernel/
  current.json            { active, previous, installedAt, manifest }
  dsh-<v>+suite-<v>/      immutable versioned kernel
    manifest.json         KernelManifest (dshVersion, suiteVersion, platform, arch, integrity)
    node/                 Node.js binary
    app/                  package.json + node_modules (dsh + suite, npm-flattened)
  staging/                download/extract workspace (cleaned after install)
```

`current.json` is the single source of activation truth. Update flow:

1. **Resolve** the newest version from the npm registry dist-tag
   (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`: `stable` = `latest` tag, `beta` = `next` tag for rc
   builds, `alpha` = `alpha` tag — the same families dsh's own release
   pipeline publishes). A prerelease current kernel follows the highest
   version across all prerelease tags (alpha/next/latest).
2. **Download** the runtime tarball
   (`dsh-runtime-<platform>-<arch>-<version>.tgz`) from the dedicated
   `runtime-<dshVersion>` GitHub Release (created published by CI; see §10),
   with a mirror chain; verify the **trusted sha512** (metadata sidecar
   fetched from the official host first — mirrors can never substitute
   content because every candidate is checked against the same digest).
   Before offering an update, the shell probes whether this artifact exists —
    a newer npm version without built artifacts reports "artefato ainda não publicado"
   instead of failing the update.
3. **Extract** into `staging/`, validate the inner `manifest.json` and that
   platform/arch match the current OS.
4. **Activate** atomically: rewrite `current.json` to
   `{ active: new, previous: old }`, then restart the server and health-check.
5. **Rollback**: if the freshly activated kernel fails to become healthy
   twice in a row, the shell rolls `current.json` back to `previous` once and
   restarts, then surfaces the error instead of looping.
6. **Cleanup**: after a healthy boot, drop any versioned dirs that are
   neither active nor previous, plus `staging/`.

The shell checks for kernel updates every 6 h (`KERNEL_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`)
and via the tray menu (both skipped in dev mode); it does not check at
startup — a missing/broken kernel is simply (re)installed during boot. A
background check finding a newer kernel does not pop a modal and never
  auto-installs: it shows a persistent bottom-right card (Mais tarde / Atualizar agora,
`src/main/update-card.ts` `KERNEL_UPDATE_CARD_SCRIPT`) that resolves to the
  update flow when the user clicks Atualizar agora. Shell updates are checked 10 s
after boot and via the tray.

### Update timing gotcha (learned the hard way)

- npm and GitHub publish on **different clocks**: a new dsh dist-tag goes
  live on npm before CI finishes building/uploading the 6-cell runtime
  matrix, so `runtime-<dshVersion>` can lag by ~30 min to hours. A check in
  that window reports "artefato ainda não publicado" (artifact pending) — by design the
  shell never offers an update whose tarball cannot yet download. **No new
  shell release is ever needed for a kernel update**; users just re-check
  from the tray.
- Before diagnosing user reports as network issues, verify the artifact
  release is complete:
  `gh api repos/JochenYang/dsh-app/releases/tags/runtime-<v> --jq '.assets[].name'`
  must list all 6 cells (tgz + .sha512 + `manifest-<platform>-<arch>.json`),
  and each sidecar sha512 must equal the manifest's `integrity`. A missing
  cell makes that platform report "artifact pending" while others succeed.
- Rebuild the runtime + bundled kernel locally when bumping dsh:
  1. Bump every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` devDependency in `package.json` **and in
     every `plugins/*/package.json`** to the same `^`-coupled line — a stale
     plugin lockfile dual-instances dsh-llm and breaks plugin typecheck.
     Root dependency changes use plain `npm install`; plugin-local installs
     use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` **inside the plugin dir only**
     (plain install there re-pulls peers; `--legacy-peer-deps` at the ROOT
     prunes the peer-only tree from package-lock.json and once broke
     `npm ci` in every CI job). When switching kernel lines (rc→alpha),
     delete root `node_modules/` first — stale trees cause ERESOLVE that
     tempts a root `--legacy-peer-deps`, which writes an incomplete lockfile
     (missing peer entries) that fails CI's strict `npm ci` on all platforms;
     a clean strict install resolves the new line fine.
  2. `node scripts/build-runtime.mjs <platform> <arch> <version>`, then
     `node scripts/prepare-bundled-kernel.mjs <platform> <arch>`
     (both outputs are gitignored; CI rebuilds them from the dist-tag).
     Omit `<version>` to resolve the followed line's dist-tag instead.
  3. Verify: `npm run typecheck`, then smoke-run the kernel with the bundled
     node (`<runtime>/app` → `node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js --version`).

  Step 1 is the only step that moves the kernel line. Which dist-tag a build
  follows is derived from those devDependencies by `scripts/kernel-line.mjs`,
  and the resolved version is asserted to satisfy them — so a build that would
  bundle a kernel from another line fails instead of shipping (see §10 for the
  incident that replaced). `DSH_APP_CHANNEL` overrides the derivation for a
  deliberate cross-line build.

## 5. Gerenciamento do processo do servidor

- The shell picks a **free port at runtime** (`net.listen(0)`) and pins the
  host to `127.0.0.1` (loopback passes dsh's trusted-host fence). The
  `DshServer` also **harvests the real settled URL** from the child's
  `dsh web:` stdout line, closing the find-free-port race.
- Health = HTTP 200 on the server root within `90_000` ms (`SERVER_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_MS`).
- Crash → restart with backoff (1 s, 2 s); repeated failure → kernel rollback,
  then app exit with an error dialog.
- Shutdown: SIGTERM → 8 s grace (`SERVER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS`) → SIGKILL; on
  Windows a shell-mode child is killed via `taskkill /T`.
- Child stdout/stderr are line-buffered, capped at 2000 chars, **redacted**
  against credential-looking fragments, tee'd to
  `$DSH_APP_LOG_DIR/logs/dsh-server-*.log` (defaults to `logs/` under the
  working directory — that's what the repo-level `logs/` dir is).
- Tray app behavior: closing the window hides it, `window-all-closed` keeps
  the app running, quit happens via the tray menu.

## 6. Integração do suite de marca (`plugins/`)

Sixteen dsh plugins ship with the product, layered on upstream **without forking
it**. `plugins/README.md` is the authoritative roster — each plugin's side,
role and status (including which are still scaffolds). Start there when you
need the list; the five sites it must stay in sync with are under "Suite
plugin list sync" below.

Two seams are stitched at every server start (`brand-suite.ts`):

1. **Module resolution**: each plugin is symlinked (junction on Windows) into
   `$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules/@dsh-app/<dir>` (`$DSH_HOME` defaults to
   `~/.dsh`, overridable). Dev sources are the repo's `plugins/*`; prod
   sources are the active kernel's `app/node_modules/@dsh-app/*` (npm-installed
   via `file:` references by `scripts/build-runtime.mjs`).
2. **Loader overlay**: `plugins/dsh-app.patch.yml` is copied into `userData`
   and passed to `dsh web --patch ...`. It inserts all sixteen suite entries
   after every bundle layer and the profile's own patch (last write wins per
   row; the upstream Models settings page stays enabled — the brand shadow
   was retired).

Both seams **degrade gracefully**: a kernel without the suite plugins (e.g. a
rollback target) boots vanilla — no links, no overlay, boot is never blocked
by brand wiring.

### Suite plugin list sync (learned the hard way)

The suite member list lives in **five** places and they must match exactly:
`plugins/dsh-app.patch.yml` (insert rows), `scripts/kernel-line.mjs`
(`SUITE_PLUGINS` — also what the suite version hash is derived from),
`src/main/brand-suite.ts` (`SUITE_PLUGIN_DIRS`), `scripts/smoke-suite.mjs`
(`SUITE_DIRS`), and the pre-build loop in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
Adding an overlay row without its package in
the build list ships a runtime the loader cannot compose — every suite page
(settings sections, sidebar dock views) silently disappears behind the
fail-soft vanilla boot (v0.9.6→v0.9.8 incident: MCP/hooks rows without their
packages). When adding/removing a suite plugin, update all five sites in the
same commit, then run `smoke-suite.mjs --tgz` against a fresh local build:
it fails fast on a missing package instead of a silent vanilla boot.

### Upstream API drift (learned the hard way)

Structural slices plus `as unknown as` casts bypass the type gate: when the
kernel deletes an API (alpha.4 dropped the `Session.events` getter for
`snapshotEvents()`), plugin typecheck and unit tests stay green while the
runtime throws — the memory distiller (and parts of swarm/archives) failed
silently for days behind fail-soft catches. After every kernel-line bump,
verify each suite plugin's behavior **end-to-end at runtime** (a tiny probe
plugin can drive a real turn and watch the effect), never trust
compile-green across the plugin/kernel boundary.

## 7. Comandos de build, desenvolvimento e verificação

Prerequisites (one-time): a sibling `deepseek-harness` checkout
(`../deepseek-harness`) with `pnpm install` + `pnpm run build:web`, then
`npm install` in this repo.

```sh
# Type check (main shell + kernel). This is the primary compile gate.
npm run typecheck

# Full build: tsc -> dist/, then copy static/ assets + the brand overlay.
npm run build

# Build then launch Electron (production-like path).
npm start

# Dev mode (uses the local harness checkout, no downloads). `npm run dev` is
# the cross-platform one-liner: it sets DSH_APP_DEV=1, probes ../deepseek-harness
# and ../../deepseek-harness for the checkout, then builds + launches.
# PowerShell:  $env:DSH_APP_DEV="1"; npm start
# Override checkout:  $env:DSH_APP_DEV_RUNTIME="D:/.../deepseek-harness"
# cmd:  set DSH_APP_DEV=1 && npm start   (PowerShell does NOT support VAR=1 cmd)

# Package installers (electron-builder).
npm run dist:win     # NSIS x64+arm64
npm run dist:mac     # dmg+zip x64+arm64
npm run dist:linux   # AppImage+deb x64+arm64

# Build a kernel runtime artifact (CI does this per OS/arch).
node scripts/build-runtime.mjs win32 x64              # resolves the followed line's dist-tag
node scripts/build-runtime.mjs win32 x64 0.1.5-rc.1   # or pin one explicitly (asserted)
```

Plugin builds (CI runs these before `build-runtime`):

```sh
node plugins/plugin-<name>/build.mjs        # esbuild -> lib/ (all plugins except brand)
(cd plugins/plugin-brand && npm run build)  # tsc -> lib/
(cd plugins/plugin-memory && npm test)      # node:test suites (esbuild bundles TS -> .test-dist)
(cd plugins/plugin-archives && npm test)    # same harness: /delete + /prune contract tests
```

> Tests live in `plugins/plugin-memory/tests/`, `plugins/plugin-swarm/tests/`,
> `plugins/plugin-usage/tests/`, `plugins/plugin-hooks/tests/`,
> `plugins/plugin-mcp/tests/`, `plugins/plugin-archives/tests/`,
> `plugins/plugin-presets/tests/`, `plugins/plugin-doc/tests/`,
> `plugins/plugin-sheet/tests/` and `plugins/plugin-pdf/tests/`
> (node:test, `npm test` inside each plugin — `scripts/test.mjs` is the shared
> esbuild + `node --test` wrapper). The shell/kernel have no test
> runner; verification is `npm run typecheck` + manual run in dev mode.
> Manual/probe helpers live in `scripts/`: `probe-mirror.mjs`,
> `probe-drag.cjs` (**keep its CSS in sync with** `src/main/window.ts`
> `DESKTOP_CHROME_CSS`), `probe-update-card.cjs`, `probe-shell-update.mjs`,
> `capture.mjs`.

## 8. Variáveis de ambiente

| Variable | Used in | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DSH_APP_DEV=1` | `src/main/index.ts` | Dev mode: use local checkout instead of downloaded kernel |
| `DSH_APP_DEV_RUNTIME` | `src/main/index.ts` | Override the dev harness checkout path |
| `DSH_APP_CHANNEL` | `index.ts`, `dev.ts`, `scripts/kernel-line.mjs` | Kernel line: `alpha` → `alpha` dist-tag; `beta` → `next` (rc); anything else = stable (`latest`). At runtime it picks the update channel (default `stable`); at build time it is only an explicit cross-line override — the default comes from `package.json`'s `@deepseek-ai/dsh*` devDependencies |
| `DSH_APP_ARTIFACT_OWNER` / `DSH_APP_ARTIFACT_REPO` | `index.ts` | GitHub owner/repo hosting runtime artifacts (defaults to `JochenYang` / `dsh-app`) |
| `DSH_APP_NPM_REGISTRIES` | `sources/registry.ts` | Comma-separated registry chain replacing the default (`npmjs.org` → `npmmirror.com`) |
| `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY` | `sources/registry.ts` | Single-registry override; npmmirror still appended as fallback |
| `DSH_APP_GITHUB_MIRRORS` | `sources/artifact.ts` | Comma-separated mirror URL prefixes; empty value disables mirrors |
| `DSH_APP_SUITE_VERSION` | `scripts/kernel-line.mjs`, `dev.ts` | Brand suite version in the runtime manifest (default: content hash of the sixteen plugin versions) |
| `DSH_APP_LOG_DIR` | `server.ts`, `index.ts` | Log directory (default: `<userData>/logs`) |
| `DSH_HOME` | `brand-suite.ts` | dsh profiles home (default `~/.dsh`) |
| `DSH_VERSION` | `build-runtime.mjs` | Kernel version to bundle (else resolved from the followed line's dist-tag at build time, then asserted against the followed spec) |

## 9. Convenções de código e contribuição

- **Language**: code comments and technical docs are **English**
  (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, JSDoc). **User-facing strings are pt-BR** — status
  messages, dialogs, and the setup window are Portuguese (Brazil). New UI copy should be pt-BR
  unless a project decision says otherwise. The repository README ships in
  Portuguese (Brazil) (`README.md`) and English (`README.en.md`) with a top-of-file
  language switcher; keep both in sync and update both on every README change.
- **TypeScript**: `strict` mode; avoid `any`. Shell code is CommonJS with
  Node resolution; the client plugin uses `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` and
  imports local files with explicit `.ts` extensions (`./client/models-store.ts`).
- **Desktop adaptation must stay shell-side**: inject through
  `executeJavaScript`/stylesheets and `--patch` overlays only — never modify
  harness source. Keep the drag-region CSS mirrored in `probe-drag.cjs`.
- **No native browser dialogs in client UI**: never `window.alert` /
  `window.confirm` / `window.prompt` — confirmations render the in-app modal
  idiom instead (mask + centered alias-token card, Esc/mask = cancel, Enter =
  primary), the same design as the shell's close/update dialogs.
  `src/main/in-frame-dialog.ts` is the reference implementation; client
  plugins port it as React (see `plugins/plugin-mcp/src/client/confirm-dialog.tsx`).
  All copy pt-BR.
- **Security invariants to preserve** (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §6):
  - Main window: `contextIsolation`, `sandbox`, `nodeIntegration:false`, and
    **no preload** for the remote-origin dsh UI.
  - Bind only to `127.0.0.1`; confine navigation to the local server origin,
    everything else → `shell.openExternal`.
  - Kernel downloads are **sha512-verified before activation**; keep the
    metadata-from-official-host-first rule so mirrors can't swap content.
  - Redact credential-looking fragments (`api[key|_key]`, `authorization`,
    `token`) in child logs; cap log line length.
  - Never hardcode secrets. API keys are stored via dsh's own credential
    store (`credentials.set`), not in plain settings.
- **Failure paths**: user-facing error messages are stable, actionable,
  pt-BR, and must not leak sensitive detail.
- **Gate commands must run bare — never behind a pipe**: `npm run typecheck
  2>&1 | tail -2 && git commit` commits even when typecheck fails, because
  `&&` sees `tail`'s exit code, not tsc's. Run the gate first, check
  `EXIT=$?`/the tool result, and only then commit. (A broken commit from this
  exact pattern had to be amended once already.)
- **No backticks inside template-literal CSS/scripts**: `DESKTOP_CHROME_CSS`
  and the injected scripts are backtick literals — a backtick in a comment
  or copy silently terminates the string and only surfaces as a syntax error
  at the next typecheck. Use plain quotes in embedded comments.
- **Injected `executeJavaScript` promises must not resolve eagerly**: the
  chrome-sync loop in `src/main/window.ts` awaits `OBSERVER_SCRIPT` and
  re-enters on *every* resolution, so a promise that resolves on entry once
  the color is already known becomes a tight main↔renderer round-trip —
  measured ~5-8k `executeJavaScript` calls/s and ~9% total CPU (4% main +
  4-5% renderer) with the window sitting idle. Keep such promises
  change-triggered and let the in-page guard park them (`push()` returns early
  on an unchanged sample). Triaging idle burn: sample per-process CPU first —
  **GPU ≈ 0% beside non-zero main + renderer means an IPC loop, not
  rendering**; then reproduce the loop alone against a blank page to separate
  it from the harness renderer's own work.
- **Generated/tracked**: `dist/`, `release/`, `runtime-dist/`,
  `plugins/*/lib/`, `logs/`, `scratch/`, `*.tgz`, `*.log` are gitignored —
  don't commit build output.
- **Commits** follow `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`) with
  an English imperative subject; the repo history uses `feat`/`fix` prefixes.
  The body lists the root cause and each change as bullets (`- `), then
  closes with a `Verified:` line — no prose paragraphs. Wrap at ~72 chars.

## 10. Release / implantação

### CI pipeline

`release.yml` triggers on a `v*` tag push (or `workflow_dispatch` with an
optional `dsh_version` input). Tag pushes run the full pipeline;
`workflow_dispatch` is the **runtime-only** path (publish kernel artifacts
for a dsh version without cutting a shell release):

- **resolve**: derives the kernel line from `package.json` (see below),
  resolves it to a version, and asserts that version satisfies the followed
  spec. It reuses an existing `runtime-<dshVersion>` release only when all 6
  cells are present **and** that release's `suiteVersion` matches this tree's
  — a complete-but-stale runtime, or one whose manifest cannot be read,
  triggers a rebuild instead. On reuse the app job downloads the assets from
  the release, so shell-only releases never rebuild an unchanged kernel.
  Dispatch always builds, and its `dsh_version` input is asserted the same way.
- **runtime**: a 6-cell matrix (win32/darwin/linux × x64/arm64) builds the
  suite plugins, then `build-runtime.mjs`, and uploads
  `dsh-runtime-<os>-<arch>-<ver>.tgz` + `.sha512` + per-cell `manifest.json`
  to the dedicated **`runtime-<dshVersion>`** release (created **published**
  if absent — `GitHubArtifactResolver` resolves exactly this tag shape).
  The release MUST stay flagged **prerelease**: GitHub's `/releases/latest`
  alias resolves to the newest non-draft, non-prerelease release, so a fresh
  runtime tag would hijack it (it carries no `latest.yml`) and break the
  shell app-update check with a metadata 404 — exactly what happened when
  `runtime-0.1.5-rc.2` outranked `v0.11.4`.
- **app** (tag pushes only): builds + packages the shell per OS with
  `electron-builder` and `--publish always`; macOS notarization via
  `--config.mac.notarize=true` when Apple signing secrets are present.

Mirroring to ModelScope is a **separate workflow**,
`.github/workflows/publish-mirror.yml`, triggered by
`on: release: types: [published]` — the moment the draft is flipped (SOP step
5) — and never when the app matrix merely finishes, so a version discarded
during review is never mirrored. It also runs on `workflow_dispatch`
(`-f tag=v0.11.7`) for backfill, `-f mode=diagnose` for a commit-endpoint
probe and `-f mode=prune-probe` to verify the delete path. A failed or skipped
mirror cannot roll back the release (different run, and the release is already
published by then), and the workflow's tag filter keeps `runtime-*` releases
out.

The upload uses the **official ModelScope Python SDK**
(`modelscope.hub.api.HubApi.upload_folder` / `upload_file` / `delete_files`,
pinned in
`MODELSCOPE_SDK_VERSION`), not the batch -> PUT -> commit path hand-rolled in
`scripts/publish-modelscope.mjs`: our client retried a rejected commit once
with no backoff and lost `503 commit publisher unavailable` races, while the
SDK retries a commit up to 5 times with exponential backoff and honours
`Retry-After`. Workflow-level `concurrency: publish-mirror`
(`cancel-in-progress: false`) serializes **every** mirror run repo-wide,
including manual ones from other branches, so only one multi-GB commit
pipeline targets the repo at a time — the overlapping backfills were the
suspected source of the 503 storm. `scripts/publish-modelscope.mjs` and
`scripts/diagnose-modelscope-upload.mjs` stay for manual/local drills; CI does
not call them.

`releases/versions.json` is rebuilt from the **published** copy (public `repo`
API read; a `{Data: ...}` envelope is unwrapped) plus this version, and is
committed last, so a partial upload never advertises a version whose assets are
missing. The merge refuses to shrink the entry count — that would mean a lost
history — and any read failure other than a genuine 404 fails the run instead
of rebuilding the index from empty (assets can be re-uploaded, history cannot).
The first step records `SKIPPED` in `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` when
`MODELSCOPE_TOKEN` is unset (the mirror is optional; the release is
unaffected), and an unset `MODELSCOPE_REPO` falls back to the lowercased GitHub
`owner/name`.

### Mirror retention (ModelScope)

Every `mode=mirror` run also prunes the mirror, which would otherwise grow by
roughly 2 GB of deduplicated LFS objects per release forever. The policy is
`keep_versions` (workflow input, default **10**; stable and prerelease are
ranked **separately** by semver): the newest 10 stable versions and the newest
10 prerelease versions stay, and the tag being published always stays (a
backfill of an old tag must not delete what it just uploaded). `releases/latest/`
is **not** governed by `keep_versions` — it is the rolling copy the updater
reads first and its convergence is a separate step (see below). `prune_mode`
selects how far the version retention goes:

- `apply` (default): delete the expired `releases/archive/<version>/` and
  `releases/prerelease/<tag>/` directories, then rewrite
  `releases/versions.json` without them. An index entry whose assets are gone
  is a 404 in the app updater, so the index is rewritten in the same run; a
  delete that fails keeps its index entry (no 404) and the next run retries it.
- `dry-run`: print the full version delete list (version, path, asset count,
  estimated size), the index plan and the latest-cleanup stale list in the run
  summary, and write nothing.
- `off`: never prune versions. The latest cleanup still runs (it is not a
  retention rule).

**Latest cleanup (always on for a full stable publish).** Because every release
used `upload_folder` into `releases/latest/`, older installers accumulated
there forever — browsing "latest" showed three versions at once, and once an
old version was pruned from the archive those leftover files were
unreclaimable LFS objects. After a full stable `mode=mirror` run, **and only
after every asset upload and the `versions.json` commit have succeeded**, the
mirror converges `releases/latest/` to exactly the asset-name set that run
uploaded from the GitHub Release (`latest*.yml` included, since they are
release assets): every other file directly below `releases/latest/` is deleted
in one commit. Deletion order matters — a failed upload skips the cleanup, so
the working copy the updater depends on is never stripped before the new one is
in place. The cleanup never touches `releases/archive/`,
`releases/prerelease/` or `releases/versions.json`, so **the archive, not
`latest`, is the rollback source**: the same files remain in
`releases/archive/<version>/`. It is skipped for prerelease tags (which never
write `latest`) and for partial drills (their whitelist covers only the subset
they uploaded). A per-file delete failure is recorded in the summary and does
not fail the release; a path the latest guard refuses does fail the run. To
audit without deleting, dispatch `-f prune_mode=dry-run`.

Rehearse a window change, preview the latest cleanup, and verify the delete
capability first on a mirror that has never pruned:

```bash
gh workflow run publish-mirror.yml -f tag=v0.11.8 -f prune_mode=dry-run
gh workflow run publish-mirror.yml -f tag=v0.11.8 -f keep_versions=3 -f prune_mode=dry-run
gh workflow run publish-mirror.yml -f mode=prune-probe
```

`keep_versions` is a per-run input rather than a repo variable, so the window
in force is visible in each run's inputs and summary. Safety constraints: the
version-retention delete path is a **positive allowlist** — only files strictly
below `releases/archive/` or `releases/prerelease/` are ever handed to the SDK,
and anything else (`releases/latest/`, `releases/versions.json`, the repo root,
`.gitattributes`, traversal forms) is refused with an error and aborts the
prune instead of deleting. The latest cleanup uses its own, **narrower** guard:
a path must be exactly one file directly below `releases/latest/` — no
subdirectory, no traversal segment, no empty or hidden name — and any other
shape is refused with an error and fails the run. Each archived version is
deleted in its own atomic commit so one failure cannot block the rest; the
latest cleanup deletes its stale set in one commit; a failed delete is reported
in the summary without failing the release (the mirror commit is already done).
The upload, index, prune and latest-cleanup logic lives in
`.github/scripts/mirror_release.py` (unit tests:
`python .github/scripts/test_mirror_release.py`) — review there, not in YAML.
`mode=prune-probe` is the capability check for `HubApi.delete_files`: it
uploads two throwaway files under `releases/prune-probe/<uuid>/`, lists them,
deletes them in one commit and confirms HTTP 404, so the delete path is proven
for this account and storage mode (one probe file is LFS-tracked by suffix,
like every real asset) without touching a released version.

When a mirror fails with `503 commit publisher unavailable`, the fastest check
is a probe commit: `gh workflow run publish-mirror.yml -f mode=diagnose` commits
a few-byte `releases/.probe-<ts>.json` through the SDK. A `FAILED` probe means
the platform still refuses writes — wait (the storm followed several 2 GB
backfills inside 20 minutes), then dispatch `-f tag=v0.11.7` to backfill.

### Kernel line (single source of truth)

**Which dsh line a build follows is decided by `package.json` alone.** All 24
`@deepseek-ai/dsh*` devDependencies must agree on one spec;
`scripts/kernel-line.mjs` reads that spec, maps it to a dist-tag (`-alpha.` →
`alpha`, `-rc.`/`-beta.` → `next`, otherwise `latest`), and owns the suite
plugin roster plus the `suiteVersion` hash derived from it. Both consumers
assert against the spec:

- `build-runtime.mjs` refuses a version that does not satisfy it — on the
  dist-tag path **and** on an explicitly pinned `DSH_VERSION` — and labels the
  artifact by the version actually built, not by the line the tree sits on.
- the workflow's `resolve` job runs the same assertion before deciding whether
  to reuse a published runtime.

**Moving the line is therefore one edit**: bump those devDependencies in the
root and in every `plugins/*/package.json` (§4 step 1), then tag. Nothing in
`release.yml` needs touching. `DSH_APP_CHANNEL` is the explicit cross-line
override for a one-off build — it skips the assertion, warns loudly, and still
labels the artifact by the version built. At runtime the same variable keeps a
separate meaning: which channel the update check follows.

This replaced a hand-flipped `DSH_APP_CHANNEL: alpha` pin in the workflow. With
two copies of the line and nothing comparing them, v0.11.1 bundled a
`0.1.5-alpha.2` kernel beside `^0.1.5-rc.1` code and every CI job was green.

### Release SOP (shell version, e.g. 0.1.6)

1. **Bump + changelog**: set `version` in `package.json`; move the
   `[Unreleased]` entry in `CHANGELOG.md` to `[v0.1.6]` (bilingual rules
   below). Commit both.
2. **Tag + push**: `git tag v0.1.6 && git push origin v0.1.6`. The tag must
   equal the `package.json` version.
3. **Wait for CI green**: poll
   `gh run list --repo JochenYang/dsh-app --workflow release.yml --limit 1`
   then `gh run view <id> --repo JochenYang/dsh-app`. All jobs
   (prepare-release + 6 runtime + 4 app) must succeed; the release stays a
   draft.
   **Then verify what was built before publishing** — green jobs are still not
   proof of the right content. Read the runtime job log's
   `Runtime artifact ready: ...dsh-runtime-<platform>-<arch>-<version>.tgz`
   line and confirm `<version>` is the kernel you meant to ship. The kernel-line
   assertion (§ Kernel line) catches a *mismatched* line at the start of the
   run; a wrong intent — bumping to the wrong dist-tag, say — stays silent.
   Only then proceed.
4. **Generate release notes**:
   `node scripts/gen-release-notes.mjs v0.1.6` → writes `release-notes.md`.
5. **Publish the draft**:
   `gh release edit v0.1.6 --repo JochenYang/dsh-app --draft=false --notes-file release-notes.md`.
   Use your own credentials: a release published by CI's `GITHUB_TOKEN` does
   not trigger another workflow, so a token-driven publish would silently skip
   the mirror.
6. **Verify the mirror**: publishing the draft (step 5) triggers the
   `publish-mirror` workflow, which mirrors the assets to ModelScope
   (`releases/latest|archive|prerelease` + `versions.json`) with the official
   Python SDK. Open that run's Summary panel: it records `OK` (target repo,
   paths, assets committed, index size), `SKIPPED` (no `MODELSCOPE_TOKEN`) or
   `FAILED` (reason), each with the backfill command, plus the `Prune` section
   (retained set, delete list, index changes) that records which old versions
   this run retired and the `Latest cleanup` section (kept set, stale files
   removed) that records which `releases/latest/` leftovers this run dropped.
   Confirm `releases/latest/` now holds only this version's assets + the four
   `latest*.yml`, and that `releases/latest/latest.yml` names this version
   (e.g. `curl -s .../repo?Revision=master&FilePath=releases/latest/latest.yml`).
   Re-mirror a failed run with
   `gh workflow run publish-mirror.yml -f tag=v0.1.6`; if the failure was
   `503 commit publisher unavailable`, run
   `gh workflow run publish-mirror.yml -f mode=diagnose` first to check the
   endpoint, and use `-f only_pattern=<substr>` for a partial drill (on a
   stable tag that overwrites the matching `releases/latest` files). A failed
   mirror never blocks or rolls back the release; a missing `MODELSCOPE_TOKEN`
   reports `SKIPPED` and is expected, not a failure.

Before publishing a runtime (`workflow_dispatch` / kernel line bump), run the
plugin compatibility dry-run against a real profile:
`npm run check:plugins -- --kernel <runtime.tgz> --home <real profile dir>`
(without `--home` the script uses a temporary DSH_HOME and never writes the real
`~/.dsh`).

### Release notes rules

- **Incremental only**: notes describe what changed *since the last released
  version* — never a full history or a `vX...vY` compare dump.
- **Bilingual, Chinese on top**: zh block first and open by default, English
  folded below it, wrapped in `<details>/<summary>` — GitHub strips JS/CSS in
  notes, so `<details>` is the native "click to switch" pattern. Let
  `scripts/gen-release-notes.mjs` assemble this from `CHANGELOG.md`; do not
  hand-write the HTML.
- Keep the two languages' bullets aligned (same items, same order); record
  each public/user-visible change as one bullet per language.

### Failure recovery (learned the hard way)

- **Never re-run the same tag** to "regenerate" a release: electron-builder's
  publish is not idempotent and fails 422 `already_exists` on
  installers/`latest-*.yml`. To rebuild: delete the draft release
  (`gh api -X DELETE repos/JochenYang/dsh-app/releases/<id>`), delete the tag
  (`git tag -d v0.1.6 && git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.6`), then re-push.
- **Runtime tags are different**: `runtime-<dshVersion>` releases are created
  published and re-uploaded with `--clobber`, so re-running a failed runtime
  job (or `gh run rerun <run> --failed`) is safe and idempotent — do NOT
  delete/recreate a runtime tag, just re-upload.
- A **single failed job** recovers best with `gh run rerun <run> --failed` —
  but only for environmental flakes. `rerun` re-executes the run's ORIGINAL
  commit: if the fix is a code change pushed afterwards, rerun rebuilds the
  bug and fails identically — re-trigger (`workflow_dispatch`) instead so the
  new run checks out the fixed SHA (verify via `headSha`).
  Kernel versions in runtime artifacts resolve from the followed line's
  dist-tag (distinct from the shell version) unless `dsh_version` is supplied;
  see § Kernel line for how that line is chosen and asserted.
- **Never run two writers against one runtime tag**: a `workflow_dispatch`
  re-upload and a tag-push CI both `--clobber` to `runtime-<dshVersion>`,
  and the loser silently overwrites the winner (once shipped a stale 8-plugin
  artifact over a fresh 10-plugin one). Before any manual re-upload, confirm
  no other `release.yml` run is in progress
  (`gh run list --repo JochenYang/dsh-app --workflow release.yml --status in_progress`),
  and confirm the fix is pushed (`git log origin/main..HEAD` empty) —
  dispatch checks out origin/main, not the local worktree, so triggering it
  from unpushed code rebuilds the bug.

**Remaining pre-release gaps**: macOS signing/notarization and (optional)
Windows signing secrets must be provided as CI secrets;
`resources/icon.png` is a placeholder brand icon; the suite plugins are
bundled via `file:` references and should switch to registry versions once
published.

## 11. TODOs / scaffolds conhecidos (não presuma que estejam concluídos)

- `plugin-brand/src/index.ts`: host services are scaffolds — settings
  namespace, app-info service, desktop bridge remotes are not yet wired.
- `plugin-client-ui/src/client.ts`: remaining enhancement slots are commented
  out (reminder summary, trajectory export, model badges); slot ids still to
  be verified against the running UI. (The workspace file panel shipped
  separately as `@dsh-app/plugin-sidebar`.)
- First-run UX: kernel download progress is wired; pause/resume and checksum
  display are not.
- Optional future: signed manifests + rollback of `$DSH_HOME` settings on
  major-version upgrades.
