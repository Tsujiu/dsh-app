/**
 * The background curator — the consolidation pass that keeps a memory file
 * lean over time. Where the distiller only APPENDS new entries, the curator
 * reviews a file that has grown past a threshold and proposes edits: merge
 * near-duplicates, delete stale entries, re-categorize.
 *
 * Identical safety model to the distiller: a direct LLM call proposes (the
 * JSON contract lives in the prompt, see {@link buildCuratePrompt}) and the
 * HOST validates every edit before the file is rewritten atomically —
 * referenced lines must exist verbatim and be cited at most once; a merge
 * must produce one lean standard entry that duplicates nothing that remains.
 * User-pinned lines are additionally off limits: any edit citing one is
 * rejected whole, so a pin never survives its line as a dangling record.
 * Any failure leaves the file untouched and retries on the next trigger.
 *
 * Trigger: the distiller hands us the triggering session right after it
 * persisted entries. Two gates keep the pass cheap and rare:
 *   - Cooldown: at most one sweep per {@link CURATE_COOLDOWN_MS}; requests
 *     inside the window coalesce into a single trailing sweep whose session
 *     is re-resolved by id at fire time (the original agent may be disposed
 *     by then — a dead session drops the pass and every due file simply
 *     waits for the next distill save).
 *   - Change detection: a file whose content hash is unchanged since its
 *     last completed pass is skipped, so a sweep only pays for files a
 *     writer actually touched.
 * Files below {@link CURATE_MIN_ENTRIES} are left alone: the distiller keeps
 * them healthy on its own and the injection budget still fits.
