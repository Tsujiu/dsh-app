/**
 * System-prompt contributions: static saving guidelines + a dynamic section
 * injecting TWO scopes — the global file (every session) and the current
 * project's file (only sessions of that workspace). Other projects' files
 * are physically absent from the assembly; isolation is structural, not
 * prompt-level discipline.
 *
 * The section text is a provider evaluated per assembly with the AssembleContext
 * the agent package extends (context.agent?.session.header.cwd), so a
 * memory_save mid-session is visible to the NEXT turn, and the master
 * toggle is honored live.
 *
 * Injection budgets (per-assembly selection: pinned entries always win, then
 * the NEWEST entries of each category up to a quota — one bucket cannot crowd
 * out the others; whatever is dropped stays reachable via memory_recall):
 *   global  ≤ {@link MAX_GLOBAL_CHARS}   — preferences stay small by discipline
 *   project ≤ {@link MAX_PROJECT_CHARS}  — the growth valve
 *
