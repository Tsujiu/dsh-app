/**
 * The background distiller — the code-guaranteed half of proactive memory.
 *
 * While the in-session `memory_save` tool relies on the model noticing
 * durable facts, this pass makes persistence deterministic: after a session
 * goes quiet for {@link QUIET_MS}, one direct LLM call reviews the
 * conversation delta since the last distill plus the current memory files
 * and proposes NEW entries as structured JSON. The HOST validates every
 * entry (category, length, dedup against existing lines) before it ever
 * reaches a memory file — the model cannot write anything itself.
 *
 * Design points:
 *   - Debounce: every `turn/end` re-arms the quiet timer, so an active
 *     conversation never pays for a distill; a cold session at timer fire is
 *     skipped (its progress stays, the next activation re-distills the gap).
 *   - Incremental: `distill-state.json` records the last-consumed event seq
 *     per session, so repeat distills cost only the delta.
 *   - Self-exclusion: subagent sessions (`origin: 'subagent'`, i.e. another
 *     plugin's worker) never trigger distills — background maintenance must
 *     not run off work that is not the user's own conversation.
 *   - Fail-soft: any failure logs a warning and leaves progress unchanged,
 *     so the next quiet window retries the same delta.
